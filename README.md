## Instructions

1. Create a tuple named `zoo` that contains your favorite animals.
1. Find one of your animals using the `.index(value)` method on the tuple.
1. Determine if an animal is in your tuple by using `for value in tuple`.
1. Create a variable for each of the animals in your tuple with this cool feature of Python.

    ```
    # example
    (lizard, fox, mammoth) = zoo
    print(lizard)
    ```

1. Convert your tuple into a list.
1. Use `extend()` to add three more animals to your zoo.
1. Convert the list back into a tuple.


# This is the output:
```
The zoo is created as a tuple ('giraffe', 'zebra', 'reindeer', 'panther')
Index of zebra in the tuple is -  1
Loop through the zoo animals
This is not a zebra -  giraffe
Yeah, we have zebras -  zebra
This is not a zebra -  reindeer
This is not a zebra -  panther
Display the variable for giraffe -  giraffe
Converted zoo tuple to list ['giraffe', 'zebra', 'reindeer', 'panther']
Additional animals in the zoo ['giraffe', 'zebra', 'reindeer', 'panther', 'hippo', 'hyena','horse']
Put zoo back in tuple ('giraffe', 'zebra', 'reindeer', 'panther', 'hippo', 'hyena', 'horse')
